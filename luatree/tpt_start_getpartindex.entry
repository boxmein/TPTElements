NAME nil tpt.start_getPartIndex ()
DESCRIPTION Warm up getPartIndex to start using it in a while loop.
DETAILS
As particle indexes aren't guaranteed to follow each other perfectly, this
function is way better at fetching the particle IDs than just for-looping over
tons of empty space.

See the [getPartIndex article][article] for details on how to do just that.
