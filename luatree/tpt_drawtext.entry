NAME nil tpt.drawtext (int x, int y, string text, int r, int g, int b, int a)
DESCRIPTION Draws a text string only for the next frame
LINK #tpt.drawtext
DETAILS 
Uses TPT's internal text renderer and internal font to render a bunch of text
onto the screen for the next frame only (unless you redraw it every step inside
a step function).

You can call this function also without the color constants `r, g, b, a` in 
which case the colors will default to white (r, g, b = 255; a = 100).
