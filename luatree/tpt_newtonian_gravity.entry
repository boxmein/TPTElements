NAME nil/int tpt.newtonian_gravity (boolint state)
DESCRIPTION Set Newtonian Gravity.
LINK #tpt.newtonian_gravity
DETAILS
Sets Newtonian Gravity on and off.

Does the same thing as Ctrl+N in normal gameplay. 

The number argument can be either 0 or 1, where 1 will enable Newtonian Gravity,
and 0 will disable Newtonian Gravity. If you don't pass in any arguments, the 
command will return an integer, either 0 or 1, about whether Newtonian Gravity
is turned on at the given moment.
