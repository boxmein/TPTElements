NAME int gfx.textSize (string text)
DESCRIPTION Find out the width of a string of text in the TPT font.
DETAILS
As TPT's font is a dynamic-width font, you may find yourself in a situation
where you need to know how wide the image of text that gets rendered ends up
being. This has many uses, for example in word wrapping and text effects like 
underlines.
