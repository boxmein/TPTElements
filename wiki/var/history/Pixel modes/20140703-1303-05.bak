Pixel modes are like Properties, except for graphics! Basically it's an integer with as many different bit-flags inside as possible.

There's {html}&lt;a href="static/Particle_Drawing_Modes.png">an image&lt;/a>{/html} of different modes, courtesy of [jacksonmj|http://tpt.io/@jacksonmj], which is under the CC BY-NC-SA license.

! PMODE_NONE
Prevents anything from being drawn, like WARP.

! PMODE_FLAT
Draw an opaque pixel, aka transparency is not applied.

! PMODE_BLOB
Adds a blobby effect, like you were using blob (5) display mode

! PMODE_BLUR
Liquids in Fancy display apply this. Adds a blur and makes the pixels remain sharp as well.

! PMODE_GLOW
Plain ol' glow. Stuff like ARAY (In fancy display) use this.

! PMODE_SPARK
Kinda dim PMODE_FLARE - GBMB uses this - beams running horizontally and vertically + glow to emphasize brightness

! PMODE_FLARE
Regularly bright PMODE_FLARE - BOMB uses this - beams running horizontally and vertically

! PMODE_LFLARE
Large and super bright PMODE_FLARE - DEST is the only thing using this.

! PMODE_ADD
This adds some magic to the equation to make multiple layered particles add up to be brighter than one particle alone.

! PMODE_BLEND
Even more magical than PMODE_ADD, somehow better for OpenGL? 

! PSPEC_STICKMAN
Something very STKM specific that won't work anywhere except on STKM

! NO_DECO
Disables decorations on this element (LCRY does this as well as some magic to paint itself colours)

! DECO_FIRE
The fire/blurriness colors get decorations too. Gasses might use this.

! FIRE_ADD
Adds fire colors around the element (although weak ones - LAVA and LIGH lines use that)

! FIRE_BLEND
Adds more impressive fire colors around the element. Gasses use this for their coloring.

! EFFECT_GRAVIN, EFFECT_GRAVOUT
PRTI/PRTO effect flags: note that they also need magic life/ctype variables, which I may or may not know how to set.
