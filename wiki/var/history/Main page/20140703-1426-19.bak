This is a sort of wiki for TPTElements. It's meant to gather all this data together and link it in a meaningful way. I do not intend to make this wiki publicly editable, however this might happen someday.

Its secondary purpose is to reduce the cruft in the Lua reference, and allow me to comfortably link articles and knowledge together. 

This also means I'll start moving out descriptions of functions from the reference into this wiki thing.

Here's some example links to get you started:

* [Element properties]
* [Particle properties]
* [Function signatures]
* [Definitions]
* [Element IDs]
* [elem]
* [sim]
* [tpt]
* [Menu sections]

In this wiki I'll sometimes (often, even) show examples in the programming language [C++|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B], and sometimes in the programming language [Lua|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua_(programming_language)]. Those are necessary to talk about programming freely and to show examples about what you can and can not do in TPT. As an example, see these scripts below. 

{{function key (keys, keyn, mod, evt) 
  lastmod = mod
  if evt == 1 then
    -- pressed
    lastkeyn = keyn
    pressing = true
  elseif evt == 2 then
    -- released
    lastkeyn = keyn
    pressing = false
  end
end}}

{{    // arrow up
    if (Element_KSNS::arrows & 0x01) {
      // walk two particles to the direction and turn into spark first thing
      r = pmap[y-1][x];
      // why can't i just short-circuited-OR the two
      if (!r)
        r = pmap[y-2][x];
      
      if (!r) 
        return 0;}}
