This is a sort of wiki for TPTElements. It's meant to gather all this data together and link it in a meaningful way. I do not intend to make this wiki publicly editable, however this might happen someday.

In this wiki I'll sometimes (often, even) show examples in the programming language [C++|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B], and sometimes in the programming language [Lua|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua_(programming_language)]. Those are necessary to talk about programming freely and to show examples about what you can and can not do in TPT.
