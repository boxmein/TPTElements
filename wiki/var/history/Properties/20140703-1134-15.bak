This is a list of all the different flags you can apply to the [element property|Element properties] called Properties.

(The list is valid of commit [b699bb176f41012a43c42dbbf1ec82b7e1c27d3d|https://github.com/simtr/The-Powder-Toy/blob/b699bb176f41012a43c42dbbf1ec82b7e1c27d3d/src/simulation/Elements.h#L13-L33])

If you think this isn't the right place to be, a few alternatives are listed below.

* [Element properties]
* [Particle properties]

! Lua

In Lua, you can access all the same properties under the [elem] table.
