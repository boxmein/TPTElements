<h2>int bit.arshift (int input, int count)</h2>

<p>Arithmetic right shifting is special, because instead of simple right shifting, 
it keeps the sign bit in place and moves all other bits to the right instead.</p>

<p>In the case of left shifting, left shifts already keep the sign bit in place
because of two&#39;s complement rules - negative numbers are represented by a sign
bit of 1 and every other bit flipped - meaning another 1 will usually be moved 
in place anyway.</p>
