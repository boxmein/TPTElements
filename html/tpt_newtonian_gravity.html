<h2>nil/int tpt.newtonian_gravity (boolint state)</h2>

<p>Sets Newtonian Gravity on and off.</p>

<p>Does the same thing as Ctrl+N in normal gameplay. </p>

<p>The number argument can be either 0 or 1, where 1 will enable Newtonian Gravity,
and 0 will disable Newtonian Gravity. If you don&#39;t pass in any arguments, the 
command will return an integer, either 0 or 1, about whether Newtonian Gravity
is turned on at the given moment.</p>
