<h2>nil/int tpt.heat (boolint state)</h2>

<p>Toggles Heat Simulation. </p>

<p>The number argument can be either 0 or 1, where 1 will enable heat, and 0 will
disable it. If you don&#39;t pass in any arguments, the command will return an 
integer, either 0 or 1, about whether heat is turned on at the given moment.</p>

<p><strong>It&#39;s usually wise not to disable this, as there are practically no saves left 
that need the compatibility mode in order to work. Nevertheless this option 
exists.</strong></p>
