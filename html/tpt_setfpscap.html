<h2>nil tpt.setfpscap (int maxFPS)</h2>

<p>Changes the upper FPS limit the program will run at. This value is <strong>60 
by default.</strong></p>

<p>Don&#39;t set it too high, it&#39;ll eat all your CPU speed and make the game too 
responsive! Don&#39;t also set it too low, since UI and everything related to it 
uses the same FPS, so you&#39;ll find buttons and stuff not working.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t pass in any arguments, it will return the current fps cap.</p>
