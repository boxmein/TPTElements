<h2>tpt.set_property (string property, mixed value, int x, int y, int width, int height, string type)</h2>

<p>This function sets a [particle property][pp] of some particles. It&#39;s one of the 
most useful functions in relation to actual particles, however it can be a bit 
difficult to use due to the many ways you can call it. </p>

<p>The function actually has about 8 different ways you can call it. </p>

<pre><code>tpt.set_property(string property, mixed value)</code></pre>

<p>This sets some property to some value for every particle in the save. It does
not apply any filters to pick out particles whatsoever.</p>

<pre><code>tpt.set_property(string property, mixed value, string type)</code></pre>

<p>This sets some property to some value for every particle with the given type, 
and for nothing else.</p>

<pre><code>tpt.set_property(string property, mixed value, int index)</code></pre>

<p>This finds the one particle by its particle index and applies the property
changes to that. </p>

<pre><code>tpt.set_property(string property, mixed value, int index, string type)</code></pre>

<p>This finds the one particle by its particle index and only applies if the 
particle has the type specified.</p>

<pre><code>tpt.set_property(string property, mixed value, int x, int y)</code></pre>

<p>This finds the referred particle as the top-most particle in a given location, 
and applies the changes to that. </p>

<pre><code>tpt.set_property(string property, mixed value, number x, number y, string type)</code></pre>

<p>finds the referred particle as the top-most particle <em>of your type</em> in a given 
location, and applies the changes to that. </p>

<pre><code>tpt.set_property(string property, object value, number x, number y, number 
width, number height)</code></pre>

<p>That signature allows you to apply the property changes to a box instead of a
single particle. You can as well filter by type with the signature below: </p>

<pre><code>tpt.set_property(string property, object value, number x, number y, number 
width, number height, string type)</code></pre>
