<h2>int bit.lshift (int input, int count)</h2>

<p>Left shifting just moves every bit once to the left, cutting out every bit that
runs out of the space on the left. (You always have 4 bytes of room, remember!)</p>

<p>In a way it&#39;s a really fast multiplication by two. Watch out though, since if a 
1 bit runs into the left-most bit, it&#39;ll turn the entire value into a negative
value with odd results. </p>
