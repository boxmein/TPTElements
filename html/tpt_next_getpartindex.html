<h2>bool tpt.next_getPartIndex ()</h2>

<p>After calling <code>tpt.start_getPartIndex()</code> this function will start keeping track
of the last particle index that you asked for, and then tells you if there&#39;s any 
particle indexes after that last one. It&#39;s useful in while loops.</p>

<p>See the <a href="article.html#getPartIndex">getPartIndex article</a> for details on how to do just that.</p>
