<h2>int sim.createLine (int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2, int rx, int ry, int type, int brush, int flags)</h2>

<p>Set rx and ry to horizontal and vertical radius (ellipse brush). The element type defaults to what your left click element is. Brush type and flags are weird variables, but they&#39;ll default to proper values. Returns how many particles were changed.</p>
