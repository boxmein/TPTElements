NAME bool tpt.next_getPartIndex ()
DESCRIPTION Returns true if there's a particle ID to be returned by getPartIndex
DETAILS
After calling `tpt.start_getPartIndex()` this function will start keeping track
of the last particle index that you asked for, and then tells you if there's any 
particle indexes after that last one. It's useful in while loops.

See the [getPartIndex article][article] for details on how to do just that.
