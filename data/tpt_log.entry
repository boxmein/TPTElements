NAME nil tpt.log (string text)
DESCRIPTION Logs to the console's output box or the window's invisible log.
DETAILS
There's two different log types in TPT: there's the little box on the right side
of the command you've given, or when the console is closed, you have a sort of 
invisible fadey log that overlaps the entire gaming area.
