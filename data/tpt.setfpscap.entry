NAME nil tpt.setfpscap (int maxFPS)
DESCRIPTION Set maximum framerate
LINK #tpt.setfpscap
DETAILS
Changes the upper FPS limit the program will run at. This value is **60 
by default.**

Don't set it too high, it'll eat all your CPU speed and make the game too 
responsive! Don't also set it too low, since UI and everything related to it 
uses the same FPS, so you'll find buttons and stuff not working.

If you don't pass in any arguments, it will return the current fps cap.
